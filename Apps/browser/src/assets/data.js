      "Ontario’s probably not the first place that comes to mind when you’re thinking of an island getaway, but it should be. The Thousand Islands region stretches east along the St. Lawrence River, and there are a staggering 1,864 islands between Canada and the United States. Originally a favourite spot for the Haudenosaunee, who called it Manitouana or “Garden of the Great Spirit,” the region shines in the summer, but there’s plenty to do during the cooler months too.",
